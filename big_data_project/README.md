# MORTALITY RATE POST HOSPITAL DISCHARGE
### Objectives
* The project develops predictive modelS for forecasting patient mortality within one month post-discharge.
* Conducted descriptive analysis of raw input data, designed the ETL process to efficiently aggregate and transform data into vector features in SVMLight format.
* Implemented three predictive models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree, achieving final accuracy and an AUC score exceeding 0.74 following cross-validation.
* Utilized K-fold and Randomized K-fold  as cross-validation techniques to evaluate and improve performance of predictive models.
